HR Analytics - Absenteeism Dashboard

Welcome to the HR Analytics - Absenteeism Dashboard project! This repository houses the code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of absenteeism in the workplace. The project focuses on leveraging SQL for data cleaning and manipulation, and Power BI for visualization, resulting in an interactive and insightful dashboard.

Key Features
